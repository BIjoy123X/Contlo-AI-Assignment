Description:-

The provided code is a simplified implementation of the GPT-2 model in PyTorch, focusing on key components such as multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization. A description of the major components and their functionalities given below:

1. MultiHeadAttention:
   - This module implements the multi-head self-attention mechanism, a crucial part of the transformer architecture.
   - It takes queries, keys, and values as input and performs self-attention to capture relationships between different words in the input sequence.
   - The result is then linearly transformed to produce the final attention output.

2. FeedForward:
   - This module represents the feed-forward network within each transformer layer.
   - It consists of two linear layers with a ReLU activation in between.
   - This component helps capture non-linear dependencies in the data.

3. GPT2Layer:
   - This module encapsulates a single layer of the GPT-2 model.
   - It includes a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward network.
   - The residual connections around each sub-layer help with the flow of information through the network.

4. GPT2:
   - This is the main GPT-2 model, composed of multiple GPT2Layer modules stacked on top of each other.
   - The model starts with an embedding layer to convert input tokens into continuous vectors.
   - The embedded input is then processed through the stack of GPT2Layer modules.
   - The final output is passed through a linear layer to produce logits for each token in the vocabulary.

5. Positional Encoding:
   - While not explicitly implemented in the provided code, it's important to note that GPT-2 relies on positional encoding to give the model information about the order of tokens in the input sequence. This is usually added to the input embeddings.

6. Training Workflow:
   - To train the model, you would need to define a loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
   - During training, input sequences and their corresponding masks (to handle variable sequence lengths) are fed into the model.
   - The model parameters are updated using backpropagation and optimization based on the computed loss.

7. Loading Pre-trained Checkpoints:
   - To validate the implementation, you can load pre-trained GPT-2 checkpoints using PyTorch's `load_state_dict` function. Pre-trained checkpoints can be obtained from the Hugging Face Transformers library or other sources.

8. Sample Prediction:
   - After loading the pre-trained model, you can input a sample sequence and obtain predictions by applying the model to the input.
   - The output logits can be converted into probabilities using softmax, and the predicted token can be sampled.
