1. Rotary Positional Embedding Implementation:

Description:
Rotary Positional Embedding replaces the traditional positional embeddings in the GPT-2 model with rotary embeddings. The rotary positional encoding, inspired by RoFormer, uses sinusoidal functions to encode the position information. This change aims to provide an alternative way of capturing positional relationships in the sequence.

Implementation Steps:
a. A new module 'RotaryPositionalEmbedding' is introduced, which takes the input tensor and adds rotary positional embeddings.
b. The frequencies and phase terms are computed using sinusoidal functions.
c. The positional embedding is added to the input tensor, incorporating both sine and cosine terms.

2. Group Query Attention Implementation:

Description:
Group Query Attention introduces a modification to the attention mechanism within each GPT-2 layer. Instead of attending to all queries independently, queries are grouped and projected to a lower-dimensional space before attention computation. This change is based on insights from the GQA paper by Ainslie et. al.

Implementation Steps:
a. A new module 'GroupQueryAttention' is introduced within each GPT-2 layer.
b. Queries are grouped and projected to a lower-dimensional space using a linear layer.
c. Multi-head attention is applied to the grouped queries.
d. The results are combined and linearly projected to the original embedding dimension.

3. Sliding Window Attention Implementation:

Description:
Sliding Window Attention incorporates the Sliding Window Attention mechanism inspired by Longformer. This mechanism allows the model to attend to a limited local context, potentially improving the efficiency of handling long-range dependencies in sequences.

Implementation Steps:
a. A new module 'SlidingWindowAttention' is introduced within each GPT-2 layer.
b. Multi-head attention is applied as usual.
c. An average pooling operation is applied along the sequence dimension to restrict attention to a local context.
d. The attention output is adjusted accordingly.
